Hello and welcome to Stryd's Technical Interview!

Please write a REST API for an athlete to request a workout with their coach. Your API should account for both parties having busy schedules.

You will have 48 hours to complete a solution. It is recommended to create a new personal private github repo to host and share your final solution.

You may write code in either the go, java, or python langauges (which ever you are most comfortable in). Each has been set up with a minimal runnable REST server that you can add whatever you like to. If you are more comfortable using a different framework than the one present, feel free to change the code completely or add a new section. If you decide to use a different language be ready to explain in detail how certain aspects of it work. You are welcome to user any references you like.

Feel free to make the problem as complex as you like but don't worry about things like running a database or deployment management. Just focus on the logic of your endpoint(s) and any API's it has to interact with in order to recieve data i.e. what data would come out of a database if there was one running. You may mock out any dependencies you think are needed including any seed data.

What we are looking for:

- Knowdledge of your language/framework
- Sound logic that handles edge cases
- Good API design

Feel free to reach out to Kun (kun@stryd.com) or Evan (evanwht@stryd.com) with any questions. We will do our best to respond in a timely manner.
